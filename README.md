# sfmlTesting
  Testing SFML stuff! Mainly using this to learn 2d graphics, then I'll move to OpenGL for 3d.  
  
## Requirments
  sfml >= 3.02  
  C++ >= 17  
  
## Building & running  
  ``g++ main.cpp -o main -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system && main``  
  Will add a Makefile  
## Todo  
  Clean up code (sprinting logic is kinda all over the place & BSd)  
  Use OpenGL for better rendering  
  Use more SFML functions for testing
